# Module 1: Git version control system

This module is designed to introduce young scientists and industry employees to the crucial practice of version control using Git, shifting away from manual file backups and uncoordinated code development. It focuses on the practical workflow of tracking every change to code, data analysis scripts, and documents, ensuring reproducibility and a complete audit trail for air quality projects. Students will learn to collaborate effectively by using Git platforms to manage feature development with branching, resolve conflicts during merging, and contribute to shared projects via pull requests, establishing a foundation for modern software development and research practices.

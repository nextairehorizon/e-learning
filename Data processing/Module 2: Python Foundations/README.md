# Python Fundamentals Module

Welcome to the **Python Fundamentals** module! This course is designed to guide you through the basics of Python programming, from setting up your environment to more advanced concepts like Object-Oriented Programming.

The module is divided into 5 interactive Jupyter notebooks that you can run directly in Google Colab.

- **Topics:** Introduction to Python, versioning, basic syntax (indentation, comments), input and output (`print` and `input`).
- **Core Theme:** Setting up and working with **Virtual Environments** (`venv`), managing packages with `pip`, and using `requirements.txt` files.

### 2. [Variables, Operators and Data Structures]

- **Topics:** Working with variables and data types (`int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`), detailed string manipulation (slicing and methods).
- **Operators:** Arithmetic, logical, comparison, and membership operators.
- **Data Structures:** Comprehensive overview of **Lists**, **Tuples**, **Sets**, and **Dictionaries**.

### 3. [Control Flow]

- **Topics:** Decision-making in code using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements (including ternary operators).
- **Loops:** Working with `while` and `for` loops, using the `range()` function, and loop control with `break`, `continue`, and `pass`.

### 4. [Functions, Files and Exceptions]

- **Functions:** Defining functions, arguments, return values, `lambda` functions, and variable scope.
- **File Handling:** Opening, reading, writing, and deleting files using the `with` statement.
- **Exceptions:** Catching and handling errors using `try-except-finally` blocks.

### 5. [Modules and OOP]

- **Modules:** Code organization, importing built-in modules (like `math` and `os`), and installing external packages.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Understanding classes and objects, the `__init__` function, the `self` parameter, inheritance, and the core pillars of OOP (encapsulation, polymorphism).

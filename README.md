# E-Learning-Platform

This E-Learning platform hosts training materials for both "hard" and "soft" skills, focusing on interactive modules tailored for learning artificial intelligence and air quality. The platform supports continuous learning and collaboration, fostering a community-driven approach to skill development in pollution monitoring technologies. The entire platform is divided into four main modules:

- Data Processing
- Low Cost Sensors
- Machine Learning Fundamentals & Applications
- Air Quality

In every main module more specific submodules can be found. Every submodule contains the interactive notebooks which are used as a main resource for content delivery.
